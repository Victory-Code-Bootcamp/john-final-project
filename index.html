    <p>Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 - February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including "Round Midnight", "Blue Monk", "Straight, No Chaser", "Ruby, My Dear", "In Walked Bud", "Well, You Needn't", and "Crepescule With Nellie". Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.</p>
